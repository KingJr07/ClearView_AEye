# ## AI-Powered Eye Care Platform (README.md)

This repository holds the codebase for a revolutionary web application designed to transform eye care through the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

**Project Vision:**

We aim to democratize access to high-quality eye care by providing a user-friendly platform that facilitates:

* **Early Disease Detection:** Utilize an AI model trained on retinal images to predict the risk of eye diseases.
* **Improved Communication:** Enable patients to connect with ophthalmologists directly through a secure messaging system.
* **Enhanced Accessibility:** Offer a convenient solution for remote consultations and preliminary assessments.

**Features:**

* **Patient Portal:**
    * User-friendly interface for patients to schedule consultations and upload retinal images.
    * Secure messaging functionality to communicate directly with ophthalmologists.
    * Receive AI-powered risk assessments for potential eye diseases based on uploaded retinal images.
* **Ophthalmologist Dashboard:**
    * Secure platform to manage patient consultations and messages.
    * Ability to input patient details and upload retinal images.
    * Access to AI-generated risk predictions for informed decision-making.

**Technical Stack (Replace with specific technologies used):**

* Front-End Framework (HTML,CSS)
* Back-End Framework ( Django)
* Database ( PostgreSQL)
* AI Framework for Model Training (TensorFlow)
